**Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning 🫁📷🧠
**
**📝 Introduction**

Pneumonia is a major global health issue causing respiratory complications and, in severe cases, death—especially among children and the elderly. According to the World Health Organization, it remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.

Chest X-ray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool for pneumonia detection. However, interpreting these images manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and highly dependent on expert availability. This project aims to automate the diagnosis process using deep learning, improving diagnostic efficiency and aiding healthcare professionals in making accurate, timely decisions.

**🎯 Objective**
To develop and implement a deep learning pipeline that classifies pneumonia in chest X-ray images with high accuracy and robustness, providing decision support for radiologists.

**🧠 Deep Learning Pipeline**

The pipeline includes:

Data Loading & Preprocessing
Input: Chest X-ray images (Normal & Pneumonia)
Resize, normalize, and augment images
Train-validation-test split
Model Architecture
CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or custom CNN)
Transfer learning from pretrained models (e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121)
Training
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Binary Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Evaluation
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Curve
Classification Report
Inference
Predict pneumonia presence on new X-ray images




🧪 Dataset

This project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle:

Categories: NORMAL, PNEUMONIA

Total Images: ~5,000
